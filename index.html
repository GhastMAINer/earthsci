        <h2 class='title'>"CONVERGENT"</h2>
        <p class='description'> Convergent tectonic plate boundaries occur where two plates collide, leading to geological features like mountain ranges, deep ocean trenches, and volcanic arcs. One plate typically subducts beneath the other, causing intense pressure and often resulting in earthquakes. This process is vital for shaping the Earth's landscape and understanding its geological history.</p>

      <div class='content'>
        <h2 class='title'>"DIVERGENT"</h2>
        <p class='description'> Divergent tectonic plate boundaries occur where two plates move apart, creating new crust as magma rises to the surface. This process often forms mid-ocean ridges and rift valleys. As the plates separate, volcanic activity and earthquakes can occur, shaping the ocean floor and continental regions. Divergent boundaries play a key role in the continuous renewal of the Earth's crust.</p>

        <h2 class='title'>"SUBDUCTION"</h2>
        <p class='description'> Subduction occurs at convergent tectonic plate boundaries where one plate is forced beneath another into the mantle. This process leads to the formation of deep ocean trenches and volcanic arcs. As the subducting plate descends, it generates significant pressure and heat, resulting in earthquakes and volcanic activity. Subduction is a crucial mechanism in recycling the Earth's crust and plays a vital role in shaping the planet's geological features.  </p>

      <div class='content'>
        <h2 class='title'>"TRANSFORM"</h2>
        <p class='description'>
          Transform tectonic plate boundaries occur where two plates slide past each other horizontally. This lateral movement can cause significant friction, leading to earthquakes. Unlike convergent and divergent boundaries, transform boundaries do not typically create or destroy crust. Instead, they often result in features like fault lines and shear zones. The San Andreas Fault in California is a well-known example of a transform boundary, illustrating the dynamic nature of the Earth's crust.

        <h2 class='title'>"OCEANIC-OCEANIC CONVERGENCE"</h2>
        <p class='description'>
         Another type of convergent boundary where two oceanic plates collide, often forming island arcs and deep ocean trenches. An example is the Mariana Trench, where one oceanic plate subducts beneath another.

        <h2 class='title'>"RIFTING"</h2>
        <p class='description'>
        This occurs at divergent boundaries, where the continental crust stretches and thins, leading to the formation of rift valleys. This process can eventually result in the splitting of a continent.

  <h2 class="title center1 fix">Social Impacts of tectonic plate movements:</h2>
  <p class="description center1 fix2">The presence and prospect of these constantly moving tectonic plates can influence and play a major role in influencing our society. Forcing us to become more aware of our surroundings and environment. Shaping our society to be wary and take into account the very plates of the Earth itself, as these plates can cause detrimental effects to people's lives due to being at the wrong place at the wrong time. The destructive forces of these plate movements are not the only factor contributing to the social Impacts that these plates have. The continuously movements of these plates can cause our geography and environment to change overtime, pushing us to adapt to these new formations and maybe new resources that we can use. With knowledge surrounding these plates and their motions, we become more aware where we build our settlements and structures. Create contingencies specifically for the destructive power these plates bring, and the disasters the can follow after. The threat of death, destruction, and further devastion that can come from being ignorant of these plates has come to shape and heavily impact and influence how our society thinks and act, where it now becomes ingrained in our system. A natural part of our society that we never question and becomes what we call common sense.</p>
